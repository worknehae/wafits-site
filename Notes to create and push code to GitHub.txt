Step-by-Step Guide to Host wafits.com on Vercel
🧱 Step 1: Prepare Your Website Files
Create a folder on your machine with this basic structure:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
wafits-website/
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js
Example index.html:

html
Copy
Edit
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Wafits</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to Wafits!</h1>
  <p>Your company's website is live.</p>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
🗃️ Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub
Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., wafits-site)

On your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd wafits-website
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/wafits-site.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin master

----------------------------
when runing git push -u origin master, got this error 
remote: Repository not found.
fatal: repository 'https://github.com/yourusername/wafits-site.git/' not found

ChatGPT said:
That error means Git can't find the repository URL you entered — most likely because either:

The GitHub repository doesn't exist yet, or

The yourusername part wasn't replaced with your actual GitHub username

✅ Here's How to Fix It Step-by-Step:
🔹 Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub
Go to https://github.com and log in

Click “+” → “New repository”

Name it: wafits-site

Leave it public or private, your choice

Do not initialize it with a README (you already have files locally)

Click “Create repository”

GitHub will show you something like:

bash
Copy
Edit
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wafits-site.git
---------------------------------
Step 3: Deploy on Vercel
Go to https://vercel.com

Sign in using your GitHub account

Click "New Project" and import your wafits-site repo

Project settings:

Framework preset: None (since it's plain HTML/CSS/JS)

Root directory: / (default)

✅ Vercel will build and deploy automatically, giving you a live preview URL like https://wafits-site.vercel.app.

🌐 Step 4: Connect Custom Domain wafits.com
In your Vercel dashboard, go to your project > Settings > Domains

Click "Add", and enter wafits.com

Follow Vercel's instructions to update your domain's DNS records:

Go to your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains)

Add or edit a CNAME or A record:

A Record pointing to Vercel IP: 76.76.21.21

Or CNAME pointing to: cname.vercel-dns.com (depending on registrar)

Once DNS propagates (can take a few minutes to hours), Vercel will show wafits.com as "verified"
--------------------
the "Name" field in your DNS record is crucial for connecting your domain (wafits.com) properly to Vercel.

✅ If You’re Adding an A Record for Root Domain (wafits.com):
Type: A

Name: @

Value: 76.76.21.21

TTL: 30 minutes (or leave default)

✅ This points your root domain wafits.com directly to Vercel’s IP.

✅ If You’re Adding a CNAME Record for www.wafits.com:
Type: CNAME

Name: www

Value: cname.vercel-dns.com

TTL: 30 minutes (or leave default)

✅ This sets up www.wafits.com to resolve to Vercel.

👉 Recommended Setup (Both Records)
Type	Name	Value
A	@	76.76.21.21
CNAME	www	cname.vercel-dns.com

Then, in Vercel:

Add both wafits.com and www.wafits.com under your project settings → Domains

Vercel will automatically handle HTTPS (SSL)
------------------------------------------
🔐 Step 5: Enable HTTPS (Auto)
Vercel will automatically provision an SSL certificate via Let's Encrypt for your domain after it's verified — you’ll get a secure https://wafits.com.

🔄 Step 6: Update and Re-Deploy Anytime
Just push to GitHub:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Update site content"
git push
Vercel will automatically re-deploy your site with changes.

🧪 Optional Enhancements
Add a favicon.ico and SEO meta tags

Set up a contact form using Netlify Forms (via Netlify) or Formspree

Use Google Analytics or Vercel Analytics

Enable Vercel's Edge Middleware or Redirects

-------------------------------------
✅ Step-by-Step: Correct DNS Setup for Vercel
👇 1. Go to Your Domain Registrar
Log into wherever you registered wafits.com (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains).

🧱 2. Set the Correct DNS Records
For wafits.com (root domain)
Field	Value
Type	A
Name	@
Value	76.76.21.21
TTL	Default or 30 min

For www.wafits.com (subdomain)
Field	Value
Type	CNAME
Name	www
Value	cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL	Default or 30 min

⚠️ Important Notes
Do not mix A and CNAME records for the same name (e.g., don’t add CNAME for @)

Only one A record should exist for @ — remove others if present

No conflicting records for www — remove any A record for www

🔁 3. Wait for DNS Propagation
It may take 5–30 minutes (sometimes up to a few hours) for DNS changes to take effect.

✅ 4. Check Domain in Vercel
Go to Vercel → Project → Settings → Domains

You should see a green check once DNS is correct

You can also click "Refresh" or "Retry" after DNS is set

🔄 5. Optional: Redirect www to root (or vice versa)
After validation, you can:

Set wafits.com as the primary domain

Enable redirect from www.wafits.com → wafits.com
------------------------------
🔄 Step 6: Update and Re-Deploy Anytime
Just push to GitHub:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Update site content"
git push
Vercel will automatically re-deploy your site with changes.
